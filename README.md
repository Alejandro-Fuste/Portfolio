# Portfolio

The goal for this homework assignment to build a portfolio website using HTML and CSS. This assignment had to include at least three html documents: `index.html`, `contact.html`, `portfolio.html`.  It also had to include an assets folder that contains a folder for `css` and `images`.  The `index.html` contains information unique to me. The `contact.html` includes information for employers to contact me. The `portfolio.html` has some the past work I have completed. Once all the html was written, then styling was added to all the html pages.
